# ■ Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

[Breast Cancer Detection - AI Project] [Python 3.10] [Machine Learning: Sklearn |
XGBoost] [Flask Web App]

# ■ About the Project
Early detection saves lives. This project uses Machine Learning models to detect whether a
breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. We
compared multiple ML algorithms and found that XGBoost outperformed others in terms of
accuracy, precision, and computational efficiency. To make it practical, a Flask web app was also
developed where clinicians can input patient data and instantly get predictions.

# ■ Features
#### ✔■ Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
#### ✔■ Multiple ML algorithms compared (XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, MLP).
#### ✔■ Interactive web application for real-time predictions.
#### ✔■ Visualizations of dataset, feature importance, and model performance.
#### ✔■ Well-documented & easy to extend.
